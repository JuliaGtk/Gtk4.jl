GI.jl
======

Julia bindings using libgobject-introspection.

This builds on https://github.com/bfredl/GI.jl

It's a work in progress but is approaching a basic level of usefulness. The goal
is output code that simplifies the creation of Julia packages that wrap
GObject-based libraries.

This package currently assumes libgirepository is installed (outside Julia).
It has only been tested on Linux. However, the generated code points to
libraries packaged using [BinaryBuilder.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/BinaryBuilder.jl),
such as [GTK3_jll](https://github.com/JuliaBinaryWrappers/GTK3_jll.jl), so it
should work anywhere.

## Status

Most of libgirepository is wrapped.
Information like lists of structs, methods, and functions can be extracted, as
well as argument types, struct fields, etc.
GObject introspection includes annotations that indicate whether return values
should be freed, whether pointer arguments can be optionally NULL, whether list
outputs are NULL-terminated, which argument corresponds to the length of array
inputs, etc.

Parts that are still very rough:

* Anything to do with callbacks and signals
* Handling of non-opaque GBoxed types is still being sorted out

## Generated code

Code generated by GI.jl requires [Gtk.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/Gtk.jl).

Below are a few details about the output.

### Constants, enums, and flags

Constant names are the same as in the C library but with the namespace removed.
So for example the C constant `G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT` becomes `PRIORITY_DEFAULT`.

Enums and flags are exported in bare submodules. So for example
`G_SIGNAL_FLAGS_RUN_LAST` becomes `SignalFlags.RUN_LAST`. There is also experimental
code that outputs julia enums using [CEnum.jl](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/CEnum.jl).

### GObjects and GInterfaces

GObject and GInterface types are named as in Gtk.jl, with the namespace
included in the type name (for example `PangoLayout`). This differs from python
bindings.

Properties are exported as Julia properties and can be accessed and set using
`my_object.props.property_name`. Alternatively the functions `get_gtk_property` or
`set_gtk_property!` in Gtk.jl can be used.

### Methods

Methods of objects, interfaces, and structs are exported without the namespace
and, for C methods, the object/interface/struct name. So for example `pango_layout_get_extents`
becomes `get_extents`. Functions not associated with particular objects, interfaces, or structs are
exported with the namespace removed.

Arguments of C functions that are outputs are converted to returned outputs. When there
is a return value as well as argument outputs, the Julia method returns a tuple of the
outputs. For array inputs, the length parameter in the C function is removed for
Julia methods. Similarly, for array outputs, a length parameter output is
omitted in the Julia output. GError outputs are converted to throws. When pointer
inputs can optionally be NULL, the Julia methods accept nothing as the argument.
When outputs are NULL, the Julia methods output nothing.
