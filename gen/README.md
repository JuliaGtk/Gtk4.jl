# Generation scripts for constants, structs, and `G_` modules

The scripts in this directory are used to generate code using GObject introspection.
The autogenerated code is created in `src/gen`.
Currently, code is generated using platform-installed libraries (outside JLL's) using the scripts here. This has only been tested on Fedora Linux.
The version of the platform-installed libraries used to generate code should ideally be the same as in the JLL's.
