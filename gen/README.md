# Generation scripts for constants, structs, and `G_` modules

The scripts in this directory are used to generate code using GObject introspection.
Introspection data for GLib (which includes GObject and Gio namespaces) and Cairo is packaged in `gobject_introspection_jll` for the x86_64-linux-gnu platform. The same is true for GdkPixbuf, which is packaged in `gdk_pixbuf_jll`. The script `gen_all.jl` uses JLL packaged data to generate code. The autogenerated code is created in `src/gen`. This should work for anyone on x86_64-linux-gnu.

The long term plan is to do the same for the rest of the namespaces. So far this has proven to be a challenge. Currently, code for the other libraries (Graphene, Pango, and Gtk4) is generated using platform-installed libraries (outside JLL's) using the script `gen_rest.jl`. This has only been done so far on Fedora.

For the platform-installed libraries, the version of the libraries used to generate code should ideally be the same as in the JLL's.
