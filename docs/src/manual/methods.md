# Automatically generated methods

Like Gtk.jl, the purpose of this package is to provide functions that wrap `ccall`'s of GTK functions in a Julian and hopefully user friendly way. While in Gtk.jl these `ccall`'s are handwritten, in Gtk4.jl most of the wrappers call automatically generated methods that contain the `ccall`'s. If you don't see a particular functionality wrapped, you can call these autogenerated functions yourself by using a submodule `G_` defined in each of the main modules (`Gtk4`, `Pango`, `GLib`, and `GdkPixbufLib`). The names of these functions and methods are intended to be easy to predict from the corresponding C library function names, and most are the same as in the pygobject bindings for GTK.

The autogenerated methods in `G_`, like the corresponding C functions, use 0-based indexing, while the more user-friendly wrappers outside `G_` use 1-based indexing.
Some types of methods are not yet supported. For example, methods involving callbacks must be wrapped by using `ccall` currently.

The following table lists a few examples that should give you an idea of how these work.

| C function | Gtk4.G_ Julia method | Comments |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `void gtk_window_add_child (GtkWindow* window, GtkWidget* child)` | `add_child (window::GtkWindow, child::GtkWidget)` | C arguments mapped directly onto Julia arguments
| `GtkStackPage* gtk_stack_add_child (GtkStack* stack, GtkWidget* child)` | `add_child (stack::GtkStack, child::GtkWidget)` | many widgets have `add_child` methods, but we dispatch using the type of the first argument
| `void gtk_builder_add_from_file (GtkBuilder* builder, const gchar* filename, GError** error)` | `add_from_file (builder::GtkBuilder, filename::AbstractString)` | if `ccall` fills GError argument, a Julia exception is thrown
| `guint gtk_get_major_version ()` | `get_major_version ()` | Julia method returns a UInt32
| `void gtk_rgb_to_hsv (float r, float g, float b, float* h, float* s, float* v)` | `rgb_to_hsv (r::Real, g::Real, b::Real)` | The arguments `h`, `s`, and `v` are outputs. Julia method returns `(h, s, v)`
| `gboolean gtk_tree_view_get_path_at_pos (GtkTreeView* tree_view, int x, int y, GtkTreePath** path, GtkTreeViewColumn** column, int* cell_x, int* cell_y)` | `get_path_at_pos (instance::GtkTreeView, _x::Integer, _y::Integer)` | C function has a return value `ret` in addition to output arguments `_path`, `_column`, `_cell_x`, and `_cell_y`. The Julia method returns `(ret, _path, _column, _cell_x, _cell_y)`

If you are confused about what one of these automatically generated methods does, you can examine the code, which is defined in the `src/gen` [directory](https://github.com/JuliaGtk/Gtk4.jl/tree/main/src/gen).
They are separated into "methods" (in an object-oriented sense, these are functions associated with a particular class) and "functions" (general C functions that aren't associated with a particular class).
Constants and struct definitions are also generated using GObject introspection.

## Constructors

Constructor methods in `G_` are treated a little differently. They are named according to GObject_constructor_name, as in the following table:

| C function | Gtk4.G_ Julia method | Comments |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `GtkWidget* gtk_window_new()` | `Window_new`() | Returns a newly constructed `GtkWindow`
| `GtkWidget* gtk_scale_new_with_range(GtkOrientation orientation, double min, double max, double step)` | `Scale_new_with_range(orientation, min, max, step)` | Example with arguments
