# Automatically generated methods

The Julia functions defined in this package are essentially wrappers around
`ccall`'s of GTK functions. Many of these wrappers are automatically
generated by GObject introspection, which can be found
in a submodule `G_`. For the most part the names of functions and methods are
the same as in pygobject.

These autogenerated methods, like the corresponding C functions, use 0-based indexing.
Some types of methods are not yet supported. For example, methods involving callbacks must be wrapped by using `ccall`.

The following table lists a few examples.

| C function | Gtk4.G_ Julia method | Comments |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `gtk_window_add_child` | `add_child` |
| one that uses GError | exception |
| one that outputs multiple things |
| `g_object_method` | `method` |
