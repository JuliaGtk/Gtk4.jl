# Automatically generated methods

Methods are automatically generated by GObject introspection. These can be found
in a submodule `G_`. For the most part the names of functions and methods are
the same as in pygobject.

Give a few examples:

`g_function`

`g_object_method`

These autogenerated methods, like the corresponding C functions, use 0-based indexing.
