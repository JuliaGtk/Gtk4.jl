# Automatically generated methods

The Julia functions defined in this package are essentially wrappers around
`ccall`'s of libgtk functions. Many of these wrappers are automatically
generated by GObject introspection, which can be found
in a submodule `G_`. For the most part the names of functions and methods are
the same as in pygobject.

Give a few examples:

`g_function`

`g_object_method`

These autogenerated methods, like the corresponding C functions, use 0-based indexing.

Some types of methods are not yet supported. For example, methods involving callbacks must be wrapped by using `ccall`.
