# Julia interface to GTK version 4

[![CI](https://github.com/JuliaGtk/Gtk4.jl/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JuliaGtk/Gtk4.jl/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)

GUI building using the [GTK](https://www.gtk.org) library, version 4. For a mature Julia package that supports GTK version 3, see [Gtk.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/Gtk.jl).

This package builds on Gtk.jl but uses GObject introspection to support more of the functionality of the GTK library and its dependencies. GObject introspection for Julia is implemented using [GI.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGtk/Gtk4.jl/tree/main/GI), which is also hosted in this repository.

Most of the code for GLib support (`GType`, `GValue`, `GObject`, etc.) was copied with minor changes from [Gtk.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/Gtk.jl). This includes integration of the GLib main loop with Julia's main loop.

Complete GTK documentation is available at [https://www.gtk.org/docs](https://www.gtk.org/docs).
