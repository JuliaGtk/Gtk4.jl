# Adwaita.jl

Module for using [libadwaita](https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/libadwaita/doc/1.3/) version 1.3.

Requires and works with Gtk4.jl. This package is not currently registered, nor is there documentation yet. It is mostly autogenerated by GObject introspection, so it works very much like Gtk4.jl.
