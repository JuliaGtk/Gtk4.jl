In Gtk4.jl, getter and setter methods are in the main Gtk4 module, but most are not exported. Whereas in Gtk.jl one uses GAccessor.title(win, \"My title\") to set the title, in Gtk4.jl the equivalent is Gtk4.title(win, \"My title\").","category":"page"},{"location":"diff3to4/#Constants,-enums,-and-flags-1","page":"Gtk.jl to Gtk4.jl","title":"Constants, enums, and flags","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"diff3to4/#","page":"Gtk.jl to Gtk4.jl","title":"Gtk.jl to Gtk4.jl","text":"GTK constants in Gtk4.jl are in the main module instead of a Constants submodule.","category":"page"},{"location":"diff3to4/#","page":"Gtk.jl to Gtk4.jl","title":"Gtk.jl to Gtk4.jl","text":"In Gtk.jl, GTK's enum and flags constants are turned into integers. In Gtk4.jl, these are now mapped onto Julia enums, specifically the implementations CEnum.jl for enums and BitFlags.jl for flags. This improves understandability when a function returns an enum or flag, but the downside is the sometimes extreme length of the enum's name. To mitigate this, convert methods are defined for commonly used enums so that shorter symbols can be used instead of the full enum name. For example, :h can be used instead of Gtk4.Orientation_HORIZONTAL in GtkBox(orientation, spacing).","category":"page"},{"location":"diff3to4/#G_-contains-automatically-generated-methods-1","page":"Gtk.jl to Gtk4.jl","title":"G_ contains automatically generated methods","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"diff3to4/#","page":"Gtk.jl to Gtk4.jl","title":"Gtk.jl to Gtk4.jl","text":"In Gtk.jl, the submodule Gtk.GAccessor contains getter and setter methods, which often correspond to object properties.
